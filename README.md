# Proposed Project Changes and Code Modifications

This document presents the process and associated code modifications that have been made in the duration of this conversation. Each set of modifications is related to a specific piece of code and has been detailed as per the requirements from the initial to final state.

## Python Flask Project

This project is a Python Flask application which connects to a MySQL database to handle some jobs-related operations. During the course of developmental conversation, the provided code has undergone some scrutiny, updates, and structural enhancements to improve its readability and to meet Python's standard guidelines for cleaner and well-structured code.

### Code Formatting

#### Python Code Formatting and Indentations

Formatting code and proper use of indentations are an inherent aspect of coding that augments the readability and consistency throughout the codebase. Especially in Python, proper indentation is mandatory as it defines scope in the code making it easily comprehensible.

Here's a snippet of how these formatting modifications appear:

```python
def getCursor():
    global dbconn
    global connection
    connection = mysql.connector.connect(user=connect.dbuser, password=connect.dbpass, host=connect.dbhost, database=connect.dbname, autocommit=True)
    dbconn = connection.cursor()
    return dbconn
```

Additional Changes:

1. **Separated imports:** Following the PEP8 style guide, imports are grouped by standard library, third-party libraries, and local application/library specific.

2. **Improved variable naming:** For instance, `job_parts_services` is used instead of `jobps`, to help clarify the data that it contains.

3. **Added line breaks between sections:** This was included to visually segregate different sections of the code. 

### Modification 1: Paginator and Table Design

Some changes were proposed to the existing app.py file and currentjoblist.html to meet the following requirements:

- Page-wise display of the 'Current Job List', with each page containing 10 data entries.
- Make the 'Current Job List' table more appealing by adding some width around the edges.
- Use a responsive design to make the website compatible with all screens and browsers.

To implement these, the `flask_paginate` was utilized to manage the pagination. Also, the table was placed within a Bootstrap `container` class for better positioning. Bootstrap's responsiveness was relied on for making the website compatible with multiple screens.

### Modification 2: Changing Paginator position and Page Number

Additional changes were proposed building up from the previous modifications. The requirements were as follows:

- Pagination should be displayed at the bottom right corner of the screen.
- Don't include '(current)' text next to the current page number on the paginator.

For this task, CSS was used to move the paginator bar to the desired location. However, removing the '(current)' text from the page number proved to be tricky. As Flask does not provide a direct way to handle this, a JavaScript solution was proposed to replace the '(current)' string after the page is fully loaded.

## Notes

- Please install the `flask_paginate` by running `pip install flask_paginate` in your terminal before running these modifications.
- Please make modifications as per your boilerplate code where required.
- Consistent code formatting is crucial as it improves the readability and maintainability of your code, allowing others (and your future self) to better understand the code you have written.
